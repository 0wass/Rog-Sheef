ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Waleed Alghamdi â€” a Software Engineering student whoâ€™s found his passion in DevOps and cloud technologies.

I enjoy tinkering with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform to see how small experiments can scale into reliable systems. For me, DevOps isnâ€™t just about automation â€” itâ€™s about making life easier for developers, smoother for users, and more fun for builders like us.

I started out exploring software engineering broadly, but the more I learned about infrastructure, CI/CD, and cloud-native development, the more I realized this is the space where I can make the biggest impact.
